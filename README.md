# Image to ASCII Convertor
***

This is a fun project, it simply convert images of the type ".bmp 24 bit color" to ascii charcters.

***
## How to use:

To run it place the image file in the same directory as this file
then run this command in the terminal 

```
 g++ -o main main.cpp && ./main <image_file.bmp>
```
replace the <image_file.bmp> with the image name + .bmp 
make sure the image is of type .bmp 24 bit color (bitmap image).

This is a great image type converter to bmp 24 bit color:

the output is a file with the same name as the image file but with .txt extention.
