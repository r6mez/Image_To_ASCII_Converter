# Image to ASCII Convertor
***

This is a fun project, it simply convert images of the type ".bmp 24 bit color" to ascii charcters.

To run it place the image file in the same directory as this file
then run this command in the terminal 

```
 g++ -o main main.cpp && ./main <image_file.bmp>
```
replace the <image_file.bmp> with the image name + .bmp 
make sure the image is of type .bmp 24 bit color (bitmap image).

This is a great image type converter to bmp 24 bit color:

the output is a file with the same name as the image file but with .txt extention.
